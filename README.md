-------------

```py
from sfwas import SFWAS

supy = SFWAS()

# Allows only FWA clan_tag to execute the function
# Other clan_tags are ignored
@supy.fwa_clans 
def foo1(clan_tag, member_tag):
	print(f"{member_tag} is now a part of clan ({clan_tag}))")
	# any suitable work 
	...

def foo2(clan_tag, ...):
	clan_weight = supy.get_clan_weight(clan_tag)
	...

def foo3(player_tag):
	w = supy.get_member_weight(player_tag)
	# If Exception `NotFound` is thrown, you'll require to use get_member_from_clan()
	# Since FWA Stats likely doesn't have their weights readily available

def bar(clan_name):
	clan_tag = supy.get_clan_by_name(clan_name)
	# Use clan_tag for any valid purpose :)
	
...
```

`foo1` Describes how the decorator helps the function filter/not call clans that are not in FWA Stats (FWA)

`foo2` Describes how easy it is to get the latest uploaded clan weights of a clan.

`foo3` Describes the use of *player_tag* to get player weights

`bar` Uses **get_member_weight()** method (instead of **get_member_weight_from_clan()**) to retrieve member's weight.
